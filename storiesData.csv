1;148452340;The Meteor Shower;"They sat underneath the old lean-to, waiting for nightfall. It would be at least an hour more before sunset, and another hour after that before tonight's meteor shower. Tom glanced at Andy. It'd been a couple of weeks since they'd last been out here. Andy didn't think the lean-to would still be standing; he was sure his father would have smashed it apart. But that would have required Andy's dad to come back out here, and Andy's dad wasn't the kind to revisit anything. Andy's mother-hell, both their mothers-would've burned down the whole forest to make their shame and embarrassment disappear. Andy looked at his watch. ""Only a couple more hours,"" he said. Tom looked over at Andy. ""You sure you trust that guy? I mean, he said he was an angel?"" Andy put his his hand on top of Tom's hand, and squeezed. ""He was the one that got us out of the camp, and there ain't no way he coulda done that if he wasn't an angel."" He leaned against Tom's shoulder. ""We just gotta stay out here, until the meteor shower is over. Then we'll be safe."" Tom glanced at the large bruise on Andy's jaw, and thought about the other bruises hidden underneath his clothes. ""I hope to God you're right. I... I'm sorry I made it come to this,"" Tom said, his voice soft, and scared. He could feel Andy smile radiate from beside him. ""For you, I'd fight the world."" Tom turned and kissed Andy on the top of his head. ""After tonight, it won't be needed.""";Robot;Future;AI;Metal;1;Girls;Decor;Pony;Outdoors
1;250522030;Love;"Today, while playing with my 20-month-old daughter, I pretended to be sleeping. She covered me with a blanket, patted my back, then kissed me gently on the mouth - which is exactly what I do when I tuck her in at night.This will be the first night of the rest of our lives. After 3 years dating long distance, a 12 month deployment to Iraq, and the rest of the time spent 3 states apart due to his serving in the Army, we are finally going to be together, permanently, in one place. So impress her upper- class friends, and to treat her in aristocratic locations, I had to do tuitions. I had given costly trinkets for birthdays, almost every month, but she had never given me anything.; except once. Six years back , one fine morning, when all our group members were busy in preparing for examination, she had given me an invitation card. I love you. I want to marry you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life. You are the most wonderful woman I have ever met. You are not a ""load."" You are not a ""troublemaker."" Yes, you have problems. So do I. And together, we can solve these problems more easily than if we were apart. Problems are a part of life. But so is happiness. Let's share our problems and happiness instead of experiencing them alone. We were going to get married, and now you want to be ""just friends."" Whatever I did or said that was wrong, please tell me so we can work this out. I don't want to lose you.";Television antenna;Post Box;Erection;Smily;1;Necklace;Butterfly;Green;Love

1;364524796;meeting my old girl friend;On a day I had been to the nearest coffee shop and I was just waiting for the coffee to be brought to the table after giving the order. Actually it was in the evening just to have a coffee only for a relaxation purpose. I got my ordered coffee and had the first zip. I had been just running my eyes around the people in the shop and suddenly my eyes got entangled with one of the girls there having coffee. A very familiar face that was already imprinted in my mind before a long time. I could come to the complete realisation of that face within a few seconds. It was my girl friend in 10th class in my native place. Now she is also working for reputed company in Bangalore. It was an amazing event for me. It could change my whole life and gave a real meaning to the life. But after 8 years things came upside down. Here I would like to narrate an event that happened in my own life. Actually I was born and brought up in a well-to-do family with all its good tradition spiritually and socially. I was so loved and cared by my parents, cousins and the people around. I wished and prayed that I should get a very suitable life partner for my life. I married and started my life happily than ever in my life. I loved my life partner more than everything in my life. Days went on and as we reached on our first anniversary of our wedding I was betrayed by here. This was the eventful moment in my life. I feel sorry to say that she came to me on the previous night of our wedding anniversary with her divorce request. She told me that she likes someone else more than me. I was shocked and fell sick. Yes it was beyond my limit of suffering. This was the dangerous event in my life offered by my beloved first wife. This event could have its impact on my life to a great extent. I loved my wife to that extent that my life is impossible without her presence at all. But now how do I proceed with my life. I had thoughts on ending life, doing crimes, and the like. It simply meant that everything was upside down for me truly. But after a few days I attended a retreat and by this I came out of all these with the spiritual power. After this I could live for the truth and reality. But anyhow I could understand a lot about life and my personal life could teach me a lot of things truly. But my life was made truthful by the role played by coffeehouse. The coffee house where I used to have evening coffee could bring me many things. The coffee house is like a homely atmosphere for me because it gave many pleasant moments of life and at the same time it those moments were followed by distress and grief.;comic;robotic;human beings with antena;rain man;1;scenery;colourful imange;human beings in the hut;fantastic animals

1;482310528;A Dream;"A little girl named Sweety lived in a big village with her parents and grand parents. She was 7 years old and had a little brother named Shaun aged three. Three loved her family and the little puppy and kitten who kept her company wherever she went. She would always play in the tiny beautiful garden full fresh flowers and she watched with pleasure the colorful butterflies. She loved to go to the town in their car with her family. She loved how it ould come to life and be like one of them taking them to their destination. One day while sitting under s rose bush and watching butterflies she heard a strange sound and looked up to see a sea-plane; she thought it was a car that could fly. She was fascinated by it and dreamed of one day flying high in the sky in that flying bird.She ran inside and was telling her grandma how she would love to fly in it or even fly it like her dad drives the car.Her grandma had flown before and she explained how wonderful it was to go up in the sky and how tiny and beautiful the earth looked from the top. The next day when her dad took them all for a ride in a small boat in the river, Sweety was thrilled to see the 'large flying bird' - now she knew it was the sea-plane- sitting calm on the river.So she told her dad of her dram too. On their way back from the boat ride they saw the pilot of the plane coming their way; so her dad greeted him and came to know he would be around in their village for a week more on business. The pilot Mr. Nash noticed Sweety's fascination and glee on being able to touch the plane. He thought of his little son her age, Deon who also loved planes and being taken for even a short ride would make him thrilled. Mr. Nash suggested that their family could join him on a sea-plane ride to a little island close by and they could spend the day there collecting shells and swimming and return for evening tea.So they all bundled into the plane and there were no words for Sweety to explain the thrill of the ride. Her family had packed two large picnic baskets and had loads of fresh tasty home made food and drinks. They spent a lot of time swimming, collecting lovely shells, admiring the variety of unseen plants and flowers . They had their fill of the tasty food and by evening they were back home . Their maid Mrs. Mcdermot had steaming tea and hot scones, shortbread and other delicacies ready for them. After tea it was time for Mr. Nash to leave and dad presented him with a quaint crafted wood decorative piece for his home. He was vdery glad to have made friends with Sweety and her family and promised to meet up with them whenever he visited their village.He would bring his wife and son too; Sweety's family was invited over to visit him in the big town not very far from the village where he lived. So they all said bye to Mr. Nash and he flew off into the sky and they watched him till became a glowing spot on the horizon ad into the sun set.";Masks;robots;armor;cartoon characters;1;zoology;nature;art;articles

1;726017575;How did I get here?;I am writing this story so that there may be some record of what we did. I am the last survivor, and I fear I don't have long to live. It started out so innocent. We set out from Denshy, a shipload of the last defenders, and as many civilians as we could carry. The voyage was long, the weather seemed to get colder as we sailed south. It was a three week voyage, most of the time the sun did not shine. The day we should have made landfall, a fierce ice storm struck. The winds blew us off course, the ice built up in the rigging, until the frozen ropes snapped, and the timbers came crashing to the deck. We watched helpless as the storm drove our vessel towards the icy coast. the ship was tossed onto the rocks. Most of the passengers and crew drowned. It turns out they were the lucky ones. Frozen to the core, wind and frost bit, I found myself lying on the ground. I did what I could to help the other survivors, but without shelter, most were doomed. I cold gray dawn found only 6 of us left, 36 people had gone down with the ship, of froze to death overnight. We knew the village was to the east of us, all we had to do was keep from freezing, and make our way through the mountains. The wind sucked what little warmth we could generate from our bodies faster than we could make it. At mid day the first attack occurred. A pack of the fierce mountain yeti swooped down from a pass, dragging off two of the men. At dusk, they returned killing another. I huddled with the other two survivors through the long night, knowing we were doomed. In the morning I found that my two companions had perished. Frozen together, and stuck to the ground. I groaned as I rose and resumed my trek towards safety.;catroonish;robots;colorful;funny;1;artistic;varied;interesting;colorful

1;819563195;Midas and the golden touch;Once there lived a greedy man called Midas. He is a rich man. But still he wants to become more rich. He went to a saint and requested him to grant a boon that whatever he touches should become gold. The saint warned him but still he wants to acquire more gold because of his greediness. But he didn't think of the consequences. After a long advice the saint gave him the boon that whatever he touches will become gold. with full of joy, he returned home and first touched the plants in his garden, it became gold. he was very happy. He started to touch one by one and everything became gold. His joy knew no bounds. With full joy, he went to the dinning table and touched the food, it turned gold. he was neither able to ear anything nor drink anything as everything became solid gold. he was starving for food. During that time, his only daughter came running to him to hold him, he said no no don't touch me. But to his shock, she also turned gold. Midas understood his foolishness and went running to the saint and asked him to take the wish back. Saint also understood his feelings and took back the wish. He went home and touched everything to make them to its original state and also got back his beautiful daughter. From that time on, he lead a very happy life.;robot;electronic instrument;a dish antenna;satellite channels;1;nature;beauty;scenaries;imaginative pictures

2;518161669;character;"Stories with significance have theme and meaning. A character-based story, where coincidental happenings and fatalistic plot progression is secondary to character strengths and weaknesses, is one way, if not the best way, to achieve this. For most writers, the meaning of a character-based story is vague. A genre writer, dependent on plot twists and surprises that characters live and react to rather than effect, would believe characters in a mystery, suspense or thriller story, especially superheroes, would qualify as ""character-based."" Batman saved Gotham City. What can be more character-based than that? But the emphasis is different when trying to achieve meaning, theme, and enlightenment with a story. In this type of story, the plot actions are driven, or at least affected, by the character's human characteristics . . . the foibles, flaws, or special gifts, usually related to goodness. Of course, Batman is a good guy with special (superhuman) gifts. But his humanity has little to do with saving the city. Instead, evil threatens the city and he happens to be in the right place at the right time to prevent destruction. He is a creature of the plot rather than the heartbeat. Here is a story that has lasted for hundreds of years. It will serve as an example to clarify the meaning of character-based story. Once upon a time, in a village near the deep dark woods, Little Red Riding Hood wanted to take Grandma, who was very ill, a basket of goodies. She would have to walk through the woods for half an hour to get to Grandma's house, which was in another village. 'Be careful,' her mother said. 'Go straight on the path and do not talk to strangers.' So Little Red goes into the woods and meets a wolf who wants to eat her but can't because there is a woodsman nearby. The wolf asks her where she's going, whom she will visit, and where. Red tells all. The wolf runs off and Red continues her journey, leaving the path to chase butterflies, and pick bluebells, and dip her toe in a cold refreshing stream. When she gets to Grandma’s house, the wolf has already arrived because she failed to heed her mother's warning about staying on the path. He imitated Red's voice to gain entrance, and he devoured Grandma. Then he dressed in her night clothes and crawled in bed under the covers. Little Red arrives. He tells Little Red to come in. As the wolf exposes himself little by little, Red listens to his smooth talk when she asks him about his big eyes, hairy arms and big teeth. Unsuspecting, she gets in bed and he devours her. What has held this story in the collective consciousness of humans for centuries? First, it carries three significant messages. Listen to your parents. Innocence and naïveté can cause irreversible harm. Don't trust a wolf in grandma's clothing . . . you can get devoured. There is also the effective metaphor of the wolf for a child predator. But the significance of the story is mainly carried by the narrative story structure. Little Red is a character-based story. The plot moves forward because of Red's human characteristics — especially her human foibles: she holds onto her childhood innocence, and she disobeys her mother. This story could be framed as genre fiction. It could still be interesting, but it might not be as lasting because of the structure. Here is a possibility. Red Riding Hood is kidnapped from the woods near her house. A few hours later some bones and scraps of skin are found at her grandmother's house a mile away. The police are called and discover from the gray hairs trapped in grandma's hand-woven throw rug that the wolf did it. The wolf escapes. Red's mother grieves. This version is a statement of happenings. Red is a part of the plot, but she is not driving the plot with her disobeying her mother and her wallowing in her innocence . . . and also the author would lose the effectiveness of the wolf metaphor when the story moves from fantasy to a more reality-based police procedural. Here is another genre framework for the story. An action-adventure genre story.

2;651995388;Night Visitor;"The workers hurried -if you call taking a good nine hours hurrying-to uncrate the ancient skull found in the field some days ago. The hours drained away. At long last, the final particles of plaster were blown away using a jet of air from a canister. The skull was mounted on the stand in preparation for the professors visit. The door creaked and the frail man in the wrinkled coat shuffled in. ""Columbo?""the cheeky graduate student whom the old man cherished quipped. He ignored the remark and went straight to work. After a cursory examination he wrote down a few notes in the book he always kept nearby. Finally he came back to the students, scientists and other interested parties who had gathered here to get his opinion on this remarkable find. ""Gentlemen...and ladies, what we have here is...."". His eyes grew wide and he clutched at his heart. The next moment he was on the floor dead. The grad student raced to his aid but it was too late. ""Never mind that...The book, what did he write?""

Soon the animals gathered with their food and the picnic basket was full. All the friends set off towards the meadow. On the way they came across a stream. “Let’s climb that log that has fallen across the stream,” suggested the fox. The animals were pleased with the idea and quickly the fox, the rabbits and the porcupine wobbled their way over the log. When the animals reached the meadow, they found the chipmunks had already reached with the basket and had laid out the picnic. “How come you two are here so early?” enquired the fox. The chipmunks grinned and said, “We noticed that the log was hollow so we scampered through it along with the picnic basket.” “That was clever!” said the rabbits.

3;442783179;Ringless;Forty-three-year-old Marie is tired. Tired of being married but alone, of being a mom, of doing the never-ending household chores, dealing with incompetent editors and deadlines (she is a freelance writer/editor), and worrying about finances and her family’s future. Her husband never touches her and is never affectionate, and she sadly thinks they are just like two friends or siblings who share a house. She loves her daughter though and would do anything for her. It’s just that after caring for this wonderful child for thirteen straight years without a vacation, and dealing with a “cold” and uncommunicative husband, she is drained and ready to throw in the towel. What she wants is change, specifically an improvement on her current situation of always having to sacrifice, do things, and prioritize others. Marie is tired of giving. She wishes that she can go on a vacation somewhere quiet and remote – even for just a weekend – where she doesn’t know anyone and wouldn’t have to worry about meals to prepare, clothes to launder, rooms to clean, broken things, bills to pay and stretching the budget. How she wishes that she could just leave. But having been raised in a Catholic household and educated by nuns and priests all her life, her strong sense of morality won’t let her. She knows it would be wrong to abandon her little family. Despite everything that has happened, she loves them and she has never forgotten the vows she made when she married her husband. One day, while playing a game of Words with Friends on her laptop, she meets an Australian named Daniel. Marie and Daniel talk everyday and become close. Daniel is divorced and has two teenage sons. He tells Marie that he wants to meet her and makes plans to visit her country in about six months. They shouldn't rush, he says. Marie’s husband has no idea at all that her wife has a new male friend and that she has special feelings for this guy. Marie’s daughter knows nothing as well about the new man in her mom’s life. Things proceed normally in Marie’s household even though Marie is excited and happy about her planned meeting with Daniel. She continues to talk to Daniel every day, but she sometimes wonders why they met and why Daniel likes her.;cartoons;robots;aliens;colorful;1;life;experiences;views;crafts

3;901407652;The Road of 2089;It was a dark night and in the middle of an Arizona desert, a road sliced through the peacefulness. The road was ancient and worn. It was no longer flat and because of the past work done to repair the pot holes, driving on the road felt like a roller coaster. No one used the road anymore, because no one took the road of 2089 to visit the little town anymore. For anyone who had the patience or will to drive down the road of 2089, they knew they would be rewarded. But only a few drove the tiresome drive, since there were never any gas stations or hotels to aid in the travel. But what type of person would drive all the way to the end of road 2089? The type you would never expect. The old and weary were common to make the long trip. And surprisingly a lot of young teenagers would make the trip as well. A few adults that had lost their sense of direction, but never the young children. For what happened when they reached the end of road 2089, no one really knew. The cars never made it back and neither did the visitors. But at the end of road 2089 there is a rather large house, with a garage big enough to hold twice as many cars as it should and an the large wooden doors will open for you to be greeted by a tiny woman with large spectacles and a small smirk on her face. Once you are lead inside the home you find that it's a typical home. A home where the last thing you'll see is the tiny woman with her smirk. Once she's done, you will be done as well. Lay to rest among the poor souls who have also shared the same struggles as you. For one thing is known about the road of 2089, there is no turning back.;robots;metal;antennas ;future;1;life;hearts;paintings;animals

4;281293693;kids;"N a great forest, high up among the green boughs, lived Bird Brown-Breast, and his bright-eyed little mate. They were now very happy; their home was done, the four blue eggs lay in the soft nest, and the little wife sat still and patient on them, while the husband sang, and told her charming tales, and brought her sweet berries and little worms. Things went smoothly on, till one day she found in the nest a little white egg, with a golden band about it. ""My friend,"" cried she, ""come and see! Where can this fine egg have come from? My four are here, and this also; what think you of it?"" The husband shook his head gravely, and said, ""Be not alarmed, my love; it is doubtless some good Fairy who has given us this, and we shall find some gift within; do not let us touch it, but do you sit carefully upon it, and we shall see in time what has been sent us.""";funny;kids;science;communication;1;animal;dressing;furniture;insects
4;284026971;An evening in a hotel;I was hanging around in the hotel lobby waiting for few more friends to join in when this thing happened. An actress fully clad in evening clothes passed us. Wondering as to what was going on I looked around and was flabbergasted at the site. Other crew members moved around ready with camera, lighting and were getting ready to take the shot. I was completely enamored by her professional yet naive smile and my thoughts were no longer with my friends. She captured my attention and I suddenly felt lost in the crowd. Not sure as to how to draw her attention, I decided to send a note of appreciation attaching a flower from the table nearby. I could not wait to see the reaction in her face as she opened the paper the waiter handed over. Her eyes slowly moved up from the paper and wandered around the crowd, I caught her attention with a nod and a thumps up sign. She gave a positive sign and from then on our date was made. We regularly met at the hotel and planned to see more of each other. We knew we were made for one another and finally decided to take the plunge. Our life was literally made! We decided to get married and come here for the honeymoon.;robot;machine;slot machine;electronic devices;1;artifacts;articles;collections;designer items
